# Student Grade Management
This system currently only supports adding students and viewing the list of students. Further development to come.

Last update:
Removed all previous files, updated this README file
Added the necessary files Structures.h, Routines.c, and StudentTest.c to deliver v1.0 of this program. Minimal functionality now exists.

Latest update:
Added read and write routines in Routines - declared in Structs. This version is 1.1 and defines additional basic features such as read/write data from file and gives
the executor the option to load their own data - provided it is formatted correctly.
